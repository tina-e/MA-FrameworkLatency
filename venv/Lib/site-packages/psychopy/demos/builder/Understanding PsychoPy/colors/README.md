# Understanding PsychoPy Colors

In PsychoPy, the same color can be specified in a variety of ways, called "color spaces". For example, the color [Aquamarine](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/color_tryit.asp?color=Aquamarine) could be specified by name (`'aquamarine'`), as a hex value (`#7FFFD4`), as an rgb value (`[127, 255, 212]`), as an hsv value (`[160 ,   0.5,   1]`), etc.

This demo lets you type in a color and choose a color space to see what that value looks like in that color space. If the value is not valid in that space, the box will be transparent and will contain the text "invalid color".
