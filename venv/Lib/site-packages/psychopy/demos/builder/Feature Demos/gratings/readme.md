This demo makes various types of contrast modulated stimulus, including:

- Contrast modulates sine waves
- Sine wave beat stimuli
- Contrast modulated noise using a noise stimulus component as the carrier texture
- Adding a beat based on a noise carrier back to the noise sample to create contrast modulated noise
