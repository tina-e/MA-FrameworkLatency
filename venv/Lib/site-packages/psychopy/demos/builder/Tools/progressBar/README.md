Progress bar demo
=================
This demo shows how to use a progress bar to represent how many trials have passed.

In the `updated_progress` routine, the `progress` component (available from 2023.2.0) is used and is compatible locally and online.

In the `archived_progress routine`, the `variable` component is used to change the width of the `polygon` component that acts as a progress bar. This demo is only compatible locally.
